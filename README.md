# data-collection

In the Jupyter Notebook file labelled 'Part 1' the python code scrapes titles and article descriptions from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html and adds these to a list of dictionaries. 

in the file labelled 'Part 2' the code scrapes data from a table found on https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. Once in a pandas dataframe, the data in the table is used to answer analysis questions commented in the code.
